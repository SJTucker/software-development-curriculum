#ActiveRecord

##Overview
Active Record is an Object-Relation-Mapping(ORM) tool that links the data in your database to the logic in your models, making it the M in MVC.  
It communicates with the database to pull out the data so you don't have to write your own SQL queries. 

##Models
Active Record generates migration files so that changes in your model correspond to changes in the database.
